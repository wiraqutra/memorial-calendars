## Wisdom of Earthquakes (A Hack-For-Japan Project) ##

  * **TRY THIS DEMO** http://memorial-calendars.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pre2/index.html

This calendar shows 500+ memorial days of earthquakes in the history of the globe.
We could see almost every single day on calendar has had one or more earthquakes.
The wisdom helps us do something to survive at the next coming disasters.
